AI-Powered Government Schemes Chatbot
Welcome to the AI-Powered Government Schemes Chatbot repository! This project develops a chatbot to assist students and parents in navigating government schemes, scholarships, and financial aid programs at state and national levels. The chatbot provides personalized recommendations, guides users through application processes, and sends timely notifications for deadlines.
Live demo: https://aipowered-govt-schemes.streamlit.app/
Project Overview
The chatbot leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to offer a seamless experience. It collects user details (e.g., age, income, education level, state), matches them with eligible schemes, and provides step-by-step application guidance. Key features include:

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests schemes based on user profiles using a RAG-based knowledge base.
Application Guidance: Answers queries and provides document checklists and deadlines.
Timely Notifications: Sends email/SMS reminders for upcoming deadlines.
Multilingual Support: Supports multiple regional languages.
User-Friendly Interface: Hosted on Streamlit for easy access.
